# Hopple Project

## Overview

Hopple is a project management application focusing on AI-assisted task management. This project is being rebuilt with a frontend-first approach.

## Current Status

We are currently focusing on developing and perfecting the frontend before building a new backend from scratch. All backend code has been removed from the repository as part of a clean slate approach.

## Development Plan

1. **Frontend Development (Current Phase)**

   - Build and refine the frontend UI and components
   - Create mock data and services for frontend testing
   - Implement comprehensive frontend tests

2. **Backend Development (Future Phase)**
   - Design a new API specification
   - Implement a new backend from scratch
   - Integrate the frontend with the new backend

## Getting Started

### Frontend Development

The frontend is built with Next.js and is located in the `hopple-frontend/frontend` directory.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd hopple-frontend/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser.
